Cisco Packet Tracer Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing a series of networking projects I‚Äôve completed using Cisco Packet Tracer. These projects reflect my foundational and practical knowledge in network design, configuration, and troubleshooting. Whether you're a fellow student, a networking professional, or just exploring, I hope these resources provide insight into my technical skills and engineering mindset.

üîß About Me

I‚Äôm a professional network engineer with a solid background in configuring and managing small-to-medium scale networks. My experience spans across:

Network design and implementation
Router and switch configuration
VLANs, NAT, ACLs, and DHCP setup
Troubleshooting using Cisco CLI
Network simulations and prototyping in Packet Tracer
I‚Äôm also certified with the Cisco Certified Support Technician (CCST), validating my foundational understanding of networking concepts and my ability to provide support in IT environments.

üìÅ Projects Included

Each project folder in this repo contains the .pkt Packet Tracer file along with configuration notes or documentation explaining the setup.

1. Basic Home/Office Network
Simple LAN setup with routers, switches, and PCs.
Configured IP addressing, DHCP, and static routing.
2. Inter-VLAN Routing
Created multiple VLANs on a switch.
Set up trunking and router-on-a-stick for VLAN communication.
3. WAN Simulation with RIP Protocol
Designed a multi-site network using RIP for dynamic routing.
Demonstrated routing convergence and connectivity testing.
4. Access Control Lists (ACLs)
Implemented standard and extended ACLs to filter traffic.
Demonstrated network segmentation and restricted access.
5. Network Troubleshooting Lab
A broken network scenario where I identified and resolved misconfigurations related to IPs, cabling, and routing.
üß† Skills Demonstrated

IP Addressing & Subnetting
Routing Protocols (Static, RIP, OSPF basics)
Switching & VLANs
Cisco CLI Configuration
Network Security Basics (ACLs, Port Security)
Troubleshooting Network Issues
üöÄ Future Goals

I‚Äôm currently expanding my skill set with real-world labs and further certifications (such as CCNA). Stay tuned for more complex scenarios and enterprise-level simulations!
